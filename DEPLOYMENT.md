This comprehensive update prepares the Clinical Study Extraction System for a production environment by addressing critical security vulnerabilities, ensuring data accuracy, completing the application structure, and improving robustness.
Key Changes for Production
1. Security: Backend AI Proxy (CRITICAL)
• Client-side handling of the Gemini API Key has been removed. Storing API keys in the browser is insecure. ￼
• The application now requires a backend server to proxy AI requests. The ✨ AI Extract button sends the document context to a relative endpoint (/api/ai-extract).
• See the Deployment Instructions below for backend requirements.
2. Accuracy: Coordinate Normalization
• The system now calculates and stores normalized coordinates (relative to the PDF's intrinsic dimensions, Scale 1.0).
• This ensures that the exported Annotated PDF highlights the correct locations and that UI markers reposition correctly when the user changes the zoom level.
3. Completeness: Multi-Step Form
• The HTML structure for all 8 extraction steps (Study ID, Design, Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Results, Conclusion) has been implemented with functional step-by-step navigation.
4. Robustness and Traceability:
• A cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of the PDF file is generated upon loading. This hash is used for data integrity verification and to manage saved sessions specific to that exact file.
• Implemented Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention by sanitizing extracted data before display.
5. User Experience:
• Improved the ExtractionManager to handle data overwrites correctly (when a user re-extracts data for the same field).
• Added basic form validation feedback.
Deployment Instructions
This production version requires a backend server to handle AI requests securely.
Backend Requirements
Your server (e.g., Node.js, Python) must serve this HTML file and implement the following endpoint:
Endpoint: POST /api/ai-extract
Request Body (JSON):
{
  "documentContext": "Text content of the PDF...",
  "fieldsToExtract": {"field1": "Description1", "field2": "Description2", ...}
}
Backend Responsibilities:
1. Receive the request.
2. Securely access your Gemini API Key (use environment variables).
3. Construct the prompt for Gemini, instructing it to return JSON. (Using Gemini's response_mime_type: "application/json" is highly recommended).
4. Call the Gemini API.
5. Return the results.
Expected Response Body (JSON):
{
  "field1": "Extracted text",
  "field2": null
}
